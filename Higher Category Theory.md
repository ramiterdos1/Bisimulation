### Higher Category Theory VS [[category theory]]

Higher Category Theory | Ordinary Category Theory 
---------------------- | ------------------------
Right conceptual setting | Right coonceptual setting
 1 . Higher Algebra    | 1. Algebra
 2 . Homotopy Theory   | 2. Logic
 3 . Derived Geometry |  3. Geometry
lack of [[model]]independent foundation| Founded on [[set]] theory
 

## Higher Category Theory

- [ ] Primary requirement is a formal theory of spaces 
- [ ] [[space]] = {  topological space, simplicial sets, ... }
- [ ] Excellent candidate for this formal space theory is [[homotopy type theory]]
- [ ] [[HoTT]] has a canonical interpretation in the $\infty$ - topos of spaces
- [ ] Fundamental constructions of homotopy theory such as 
        - ==Homotopy Fibres==
        - ==Homotopy Pushouts==
        - ==Suspensions==
        - ==Joins==
        - ==Smashes==
        - ==Loop Spaces==
        - ==Connectivity==
        - ==Truncation==
